# Airtable-Foam-Submission
This workflow is initiated every time a new submission is received via an Airtable form. It automatically creates a new record, routes the submission to different internal rating paths, consolidates the ratings, and finally uses an AI Agent to perform an analysis or make a final decision, updating the Airtable record with the result.
