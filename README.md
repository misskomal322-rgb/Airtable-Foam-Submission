# Airtable-Foam-Submission
This workflow is initiated every time a new submission is received via an Airtable form. It automatically creates a new record, routes the submission to different internal rating paths, consolidates the ratings, and finally uses an AI Agent to perform an analysis or make a final decision, updating the Airtable record with the result.
The project is ideal for teams who need to automate the review and qualification process for form submissions (e.g., job applications, feature requests, content briefs, etc.).

⚙️ Workflow Breakdown
The workflow is executed sequentially through the following key nodes:

1. ⚡ Trigger Node
Purpose: The entry point of the entire automation.

Details: It's configured to listen for a specific event, which is typically a new form submission received in a designated Airtable Base and Table.

2. ➡️ Action Node (Create Record)
Purpose: Takes the data from the form submission and formalizes it within the system.

Details: Creates a new, initial record in an Airtable table to track the submission throughout the workflow.

3. 🚦 Utility Node (Path Routing)
Purpose: Implements internal business logic to route the submission data to the appropriate review/rating paths.

Mode: Rules.

Details: Based on predefined criteria within the submission (e.g., submission type, user role, etc.), this node directs the flow simultaneously to three different rating nodes.

4. 📈 Rating Paths (Update Record)
These three parallel paths simulate different team members or systems providing a rating or feedback for the submission:

Video Editor Rating: Updates the record with a rating/feedback from the perspective of a Video Editor.

Graphic Designer Rating: Updates the record with a rating/feedback from the perspective of a Graphic Designer.

AI Manager Rating: Updates the record with a rating/feedback from the perspective of an AI Manager.

5. 🧠 AI Agent (Core Logic)
Purpose: The central intelligence of the workflow. It takes the original submission data and the ratings from the three paths and uses an AI model to make a decision.

Model: Google Gemini Chat Model (specified as the underlying language model).

Configuration: The Agent uses a defined Chat Model, may leverage Memory to maintain conversation history (if applicable to the use case), and can be integrated with Tools (e.g., search, code execution) to assist with its final analysis.

6. ✅ Update Record (Final Action)
Purpose: Records the final output generated by the AI Agent back into the Airtable record.

Details: This typically updates fields like Status, AI Analysis/Summary, or Final Score.

🛠️ Key Technologies & Requirements
Automation Platform: This workflow is built using an AI Automation platform (e.g., Airbyte, n8n, etc., depending on the tool).

Database: Airtable (requires API credentials for the designated Base and Table).

AI Model: Google Gemini Chat Model (requires a valid API key).

Language/Logic: The workflow uses visual programming and rule-based logic for routing.
